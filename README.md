# Backups with MS SQL
The project idea is to try several backups types, like Full, Incremental, Differential, and CDP. 
And try to assess the effectiveness of each one.

## Compare Results
Rows count: 35k
### Full
```
    Size: 5.5M
    Specific Time Rollback: Only to the state when backup made
    Rollback speed: 00:00:04.203
    Cost: We are making full copy, to store it we required more space.
```

### Differential
```
    Size: 1.4M
    Specific Time Rollback: We can make this type of backup daily, if make full backup weekly.
    Rollback speed: 00:00:02
    Cost: The size of file depends on how often we make full backups and how frequently we do changes.
```
### Incremental
```
    Size: 40M
    Specific Time Rollback: We are able to restore database to changes during the day.
    Rollback speed: 00:00:06
    Cost: The log backup file is the biggest.
```
### Continuose Backup (Replication)
```
    Size: Same as master
    Specific Time Rollback: Any point of time.
    Cost: Doubled.
```

## Full Backup
This is a complete copy, which stores all the objects of the database: Tables, procedures, functions, views, indexes etc. Having a full backup, you will be able to easily restore a database in exactly the same form as it was at the time of the backup.

Imaging is generally more useful for deploying a standard configuration to many systems rather than as a tool for making ongoing backups of diverse systems.

To create full backup it possible to use IDE features, or use script below
```
BACKUP DATABASE [SQLTestDB] TO  DISK = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB-20221123-18-1-0.bak' WITH NOFORMAT, INIT,  NAME = N'10k_FullBackup', NOSKIP, REWIND, NOUNLOAD,  STATS = 10
```

To run restore, use IDE interface or run script
```
USE [master]
ALTER DATABASE [SQLTestDB] SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE

RESTORE DATABASE [SQLTestDB] FROM  DISK = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB-20221123-18-1-0.bak' WITH  FILE = 1,  MOVE N'SQLTestDB' TO N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB.mdf',  MOVE N'SQLTestDB_log' TO N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB_log.ldf',  NOUNLOAD,  REPLACE,  STATS = 5

ALTER DATABASE [SQLTestDB] SET MULTI_USER
```

## Differential Backup
A differential database backup is the superset of the last full backup and contains all changes that have been made since the last full backup. So, if there are very few transactions that have happened recently, a differential backup might be small in size, but if you have made a large number of transactions, the differential backup could be very large in size.

It is recommended to take a new full backup, at set intervals, to establish a new differential base for the data.
Typically, we would restore the most recent full backup followed by the most recent differential backup that is based on that full backup.

To make this backup you are able to use IDE interface, or if you wanna run it automatically, it possible to use scripting.
```
BACKUP DATABASE [SQLTestDB] TO  DISK = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB-20221124-9-57-3.bak' WITH  DIFFERENTIAL , NOFORMAT, NOINIT,  NAME = N'SQLTestDB-Differential-2022-11-24T05:57:07', NOSKIP, REWIND, NOUNLOAD,  STATS = 10
```

During restore you should restore with the full backup, before restore differential one.
```
USE [master]
ALTER DATABASE [SQLTestDB] SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE

BACKUP LOG [SQLTestDB] TO  DISK = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB_LogBackup_2022-11-24_08-07-50.bak' WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT,  NAME = N'SQLTestDB_LogBackup_2022-11-24_08-07-50', NOSKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD,  STATS = 5

RESTORE DATABASE [SQLTestDB] FROM  DISK = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB-20221124-10-7-39.bak' WITH  FILE = 1,  MOVE N'SQLTestDB' TO N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB.mdf',  MOVE N'SQLTestDB_log' TO N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB_log.ldf',  NORECOVERY,  NOUNLOAD,  STATS = 5
RESTORE DATABASE [SQLTestDB] FROM  DISK = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/SQLTestDB-20221124-10-34-16.bak' WITH  FILE = 1,  NOUNLOAD,  STATS = 5

ALTER DATABASE [SQLTestDB] SET MULTI_USER
```

## Transaction Log Backup
A true incremental data backup only backs up the portions of the data files that have changed since the last incremental data backup. 
SQL Server cannot do incremental data backups.

The closest kind of backup that SQL Server has to an incremental backup is a transaction log backup. 
A transaction log backup will back up all the transaction log generated since the most recent transaction log backup

For a data backup, the restore simply lays down the data from the backup into the data files. 
For a transaction log backup, the restore has to reply the database changes described by the log records in the backup â€“ a much slower set of operations.

## Continuous data protection (CDP)
Also called continuous backup or real-time backup, refers to backup of computer data by automatically saving a copy of every change made to that data, essentially capturing every version of the data that the user saves.
In its true form it allows the user or administrator to restore data to any point in time.
